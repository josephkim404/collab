        "Wordle is a game where a user has six guesses in order to correctly figure out the word of the day. Many players have optimized a stragety with a specific choice of words in order to reduce the amount of guesses that they do. With users figuring out strageties they may want to opt for a more challenging version of Wordle as they may get bored of the original version. Wordle Hard Mode is similar to regular Wordle however the difficulty jump may be attributed to the stipulation that every revealed clue must be used in the user's subsequent guesses. This means the user is boxed in and are required to be more creative with how they approach their gusses. However, this mode has mixed opinions as this stipulation would make it force players to guess the correct word while others rely on using differing words to narrow down their options. That is the question we'll try to figure out, whether Wordle Hardmode is actually harder than regular Wordle. To figure this out, we'll use reinforcement learning. Rienforcement learning is using an agnet to make decisions based on rewards and penalties. For Wordle, each guess will be used as the decision and the colors given back (gren, yellow, or grey) will be our reward and penalties. These reward and penalties will guide the agent's stragety for future guesses. By analyzing how the agent learns and improve its guessing stragety we can compare the agents and see which one truly poses a greater challenge for optimal gameplay."
